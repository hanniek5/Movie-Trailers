# Movie-Trailers

"ud036_StarterCode

Source code for a Movie Trailer website." - fresh_tomatoes.py

First, whenever you have entered and see the Movie-Trailers repository, there is a green button on the right that says
"Clone or Download."
Press the down arrow and download the zip file.

The text editor I used was with IDLE, but you may use any text editor. 
The website to download IDLE is https://www.python.org/downloads/ if you don't have a text editor currently.

Once you have the files and your text editor up, you just want to make sure your files are all still in the same folder,
then open entertainment_center.py from a text editor.

Once entertainment_center.py is open, run the program within your text editor. 

As long as media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py are in the same folder, so entertainment_center.py may import them, 
the code will run perfectly.

Enjoy and code on my friends!
